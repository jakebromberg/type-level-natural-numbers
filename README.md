# Abuse of Notation

Encoding the natural numbers as Swift types using the Peano axioms, with witness-based proofs that verify arithmetic facts at compile time. A successful `swift build` is the proof.

## Peano encoding

Numbers are represented as types:

- `Zero` represents 0
- `AddOne<N>` represents the successor of N (i.e. N + 1)
- `SubOne<N>` represents the predecessor of N (i.e. N - 1)

For example, `AddOne<AddOne<Zero>>` is the type-level representation of 2, and `SubOne<Zero>` is -1. Type aliases `N0` through `N9` provide convenient shorthand.

## Protocols

The protocol hierarchy uses 3 protocols:

### `Integer`

The root protocol for all integer types. Declares `Successor` and `Predecessor` associated types.

### `Natural`

Extends `Integer` for nonnegative integers (0, 1, 2, ...). Constrains `Successor` to `Natural`. Conformed to by `Zero` and `AddOne<N>`.

### `Nonpositive`

Extends `Integer` for nonpositive integers (0, -1, -2, ...). Constrains `Predecessor` to `Nonpositive`. Conformed to by `Zero` and `SubOne<N>`.

`Zero` sits at the intersection of `Natural` and `Nonpositive`, conforming to both.

## Witness-based proofs

Arithmetic facts are proved by constructing types whose existence demonstrates the relationship. The proofs are verified by the Swift type checker at compile time.

### Addition witnesses (`NaturalSum`)

The `NaturalSum` protocol witnesses that `Left + Right = Total`:

- `PlusZero<N>`: proves `N + 0 = N` (base case)
- `PlusSucc<Proof>`: if `A + B = C`, proves `A + S(B) = S(C)` (inductive step)

```swift
// Proof that 2 + 3 = 5
typealias TwoPlusThree = PlusSucc<PlusSucc<PlusSucc<PlusZero<N2>>>>
assertEqual(TwoPlusThree.Total.self, N5.self)  // compiles only if correct
```

### Multiplication witnesses (`NaturalProduct`)

The `NaturalProduct` protocol witnesses that `Left * Right = Total`:

- `TimesZero<N>`: proves `N * 0 = 0` (base case)
- `TimesSucc<MulProof, AddProof>`: if `A * B = C` and `C + A = D`, proves `A * S(B) = D` (inductive step)

```swift
// Proof that 2 * 3 = 6
// Chain: 2*0=0, 0+2=2 so 2*1=2, 2+2=4 so 2*2=4, 4+2=6 so 2*3=6
typealias Mul2x0 = TimesZero<N2>
typealias Add0p2 = PlusSucc<PlusSucc<PlusZero<N0>>>
typealias Mul2x1 = TimesSucc<Mul2x0, Add0p2>
typealias Add2p2 = PlusSucc<PlusSucc<PlusZero<N2>>>
typealias Mul2x2 = TimesSucc<Mul2x1, Add2p2>
typealias Add4p2 = PlusSucc<PlusSucc<PlusZero<N4>>>
typealias Mul2x3 = TimesSucc<Mul2x2, Add4p2>
assertEqual(Mul2x3.Total.self, N6.self)
```

### Comparison witnesses (`NaturalLessThan`)

The `NaturalLessThan` protocol witnesses that `Left < Right`:

- `ZeroLT<N>`: proves `0 < S(N)`
- `SuccLT<Proof>`: if `A < B`, proves `S(A) < S(B)`

```swift
// Proof that 2 < 5 (peel off 2 successors, then 0 < 3)
typealias TwoLtFive = SuccLT<SuccLT<ZeroLT<N2>>>
```

### Type-level arithmetic (`Sum`, `Product`)

For convenience, `Sum<L, R>.Result` and `Product<L, R>.Result` compute type-level addition and multiplication via constrained extensions:

```swift
assertEqual(Sum<N2, N3>.Result.self, N5.self)
assertEqual(Product<N2, N3>.Result.self, N6.self)
```

The `@ProductConformance(n)` macro generates the inductive protocols and conformances needed for `Product` to handle a given multiplier.

## Macros as proof generators

Writing witness chains by hand is explicit but tedious -- a proof of `F(10) = 55` requires threading 10 `PlusSucc`/`PlusZero` witnesses through `FibStep` chains. Swift macros automate this by computing arithmetic at compile time and emitting the witness types that the type checker independently verifies.

The architecture has three layers:

1. **Protocol** (human-authored) -- states the theorem (e.g., `FibVerified` requires `SumWitness` proving `Prev + Current = Next`)
2. **Macro** (proof search) -- computes integers at compile time and emits witness chains as typealiases
3. **Type checker** (proof verifier) -- structurally verifies every `where` constraint. If the macro emits a wrong witness, compilation fails.

Both proof-generating macros use `@attached(member, names: arbitrary)`, generating all witnesses as members of a namespace enum:

```swift
@FibonacciProof(upTo: 10)
enum FibProof {}

assertEqual(FibProof._Fib5.Current.self, N5.self)  // F(5) = 5
assertEqual(FibProof._Fib6.Current.self, N8.self)  // F(6) = 8
```

## Cayley-Dickson construction

The Cayley-Dickson construction builds higher-dimensional algebras from pairs. The type-level representation `CayleyDickson<Re, Im>` encodes the structure:

| Level | Algebra | Dimensions |
|-------|---------|------------|
| 0 | Integers | 1 |
| 1 | Gaussian integers | 2 |
| 2 | Quaternions | 4 |
| 3 | Octonions | 8 |

Integer types (`Zero`, `AddOne`, `SubOne`) conform to the `Algebra` marker protocol as level-0 scalars.

## Continued fractions and pi

Two classical formulas approximate pi from opposite directions:

- **Brouncker's continued fraction** for 4/pi: `1 + 1/(2 + 9/(2 + 25/(2 + ...)))`
- **Leibniz series** for pi/4: `1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...`

At every depth n, the CF convergent h_n/k_n equals 1/S_{n+1}, where S_{n+1} is the (n+1)-th Leibniz partial sum. The `@PiConvergenceProof(depth:)` macro constructs both sequences independently -- `GCFConvergent` for CF convergents via the standard recurrence, `LeibnizPartialSum` for alternating series via fraction arithmetic -- plus all intermediate product and sum witnesses, then generates `assertEqual` calls to verify the correspondence:

```swift
@PiConvergenceProof(depth: 3)
enum PiProof {}

// CF convergent h_2/k_2 = 15/13 is the reciprocal of Leibniz S_3 = 13/15
assertEqual(PiProof._CF2.P.self, PiProof._LS3.Q.self)  // 15 = 15
assertEqual(PiProof._CF2.Q.self, PiProof._LS3.P.self)  // 13 = 13
```

Since both sequences converge and their values agree at every depth, they converge to the same limit. The compilation itself is the proof.

## Golden ratio and Fibonacci

The golden ratio phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 has the simplest continued fraction: [1; 1, 1, 1, ...]. The CF recurrence with a=1, b=1 is just h_n = h_{n-1} + h_{n-2} -- the Fibonacci recurrence. The `@GoldenRatioProof(depth:)` macro proves that h_n = F(n+2) and k_n = F(n+1) by constructing both Fibonacci witness chains and CF convergents independently, then asserting type equality:

```swift
@GoldenRatioProof(depth: 5)
enum GoldenRatioProof {}

assertEqual(GoldenRatioProof._CF5.P.self, N13.self)  // h_5 = 13 = F(7)
assertEqual(GoldenRatioProof._CF5.Q.self, N8.self)   // k_5 = 8  = F(6)
```

## Universal addition theorems

The proofs above are depth-bounded: macros generate witness chains for specific values. Universal theorems, by contrast, hold for ALL natural numbers. The proof mechanism is conditional conformance -- Swift's version of structural induction.

Each theorem is a protocol with a plain associated type (no `where` clauses, following the `_TimesNk` pattern). The base-case conformance on `Zero`/`PlusZero` and the inductive-step conformance on `AddOne`/`PlusSucc` together prove the property for every natural number or every addition proof.

### Left zero identity: `0 + n = n`

`PlusZero<N>` proves `N + 0 = N`, but `0 + N = N` requires induction on N:

```swift
// AddLeftZero: for any N, there is a NaturalSum witnessing 0 + N = N
extension Zero: AddLeftZero { ... }                         // base case
extension AddOne: AddLeftZero where Predecessor: AddLeftZero { ... }  // inductive step
```

### Successor-left shift: `a + b = c => S(a) + b = S(c)`

The existing `PlusSucc` adds a successor on the right. This theorem shifts a successor on the left:

```swift
// SuccLeftAdd: for any proof P of a + b = c, there is a proof of S(a) + b = S(c)
extension PlusZero: SuccLeftAdd { ... }                     // base case
extension PlusSucc: SuccLeftAdd where Proof: SuccLeftAdd { ... }  // inductive step
```

### Commutativity: `a + b = c => b + a = c`

Combines the first two theorems. The base case uses left zero identity; the inductive step uses successor-left shift:

```swift
// AddCommutative: for any proof P of a + b = c, there is a proof of b + a = c
extension PlusZero: AddCommutative where N: AddLeftZero { ... }   // base case
extension PlusSucc: AddCommutative
    where Proof: AddCommutative, Proof.Commuted: SuccLeftAdd { ... }  // inductive step
```

### Associativity: `(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)`

Associativity is a binary theorem requiring two addition proofs (one for `a + b`, one for the result plus `c`). Swift protocols can only do induction on one type parameter. The `ProofSeed` technique solves this by encoding one proof as a seed type and doing induction on the other:

```swift
// ProofSeed<P>: a Natural wrapping a NaturalSum proof as a base case
// AddAssociative: for any chain AddOne^c(ProofSeed<P>), the AssocProof is PlusSucc^c(P)
typealias Assoc3p2p4 = AddOne<AddOne<AddOne<AddOne<ProofSeed<ThreePlusTwo>>>>>
// AssocProof witnesses 3 + 6 = 9 (i.e. 3 + (2+4) = (3+2) + 4)
assertEqual(Assoc3p2p4.AssocProof.Total.self, N9.self)
```

Universality is twofold: parametric over the seed proof (any `NaturalSum`) and inductive over the extension depth (any natural number).

## Universal multiplication theorems

Unlike the addition theorems (which compose freely because `PlusSucc` has no where clauses), multiplication theorems face a composition obstacle: `TimesSucc` has where clauses that trigger rewrite system explosion when used in inductive protocols. The flat encoding (`TimesTick`/`TimesGroup`) solves this by decomposing each multiplication step into individual successor operations, like `PlusSucc` does for addition:

- **`TimesTick<P>`**: adds 1 to Total (one successor within a "copy of Left"). No where clauses.
- **`TimesGroup<P>`**: adds 1 to Right (one complete copy of Left added). No where clauses.

For `a * b`, the proof has b groups of a ticks each. The flat encoding and `TimesSucc` coexist -- both conform to `NaturalProduct`.

### Left zero annihilation: `0 * n = 0`

With Left = 0, each group has 0 ticks, so the inductive step is just `TimesGroup` wrapping the previous proof:

```swift
// MulLeftZero: for any N, there is a NaturalProduct witnessing 0 * N = 0
extension Zero: MulLeftZero { ... }                         // base case
extension AddOne: MulLeftZero where Predecessor: MulLeftZero { ... }  // inductive step
```

### Successor-left multiplication: `a * b = c => S(a) * b = c + b`

Each `TimesGroup` gains one extra `TimesTick`, so b groups contribute b extra ticks. Structurally identical to how `SuccLeftAdd` wraps each `PlusSucc`:

```swift
// SuccLeftMul: for any flat proof P of a * b = c, there is a proof of S(a) * b = c + b
extension TimesZero: SuccLeftMul { ... }                    // base case
extension TimesTick: SuccLeftMul where Proof: SuccLeftMul { ... }  // tick step
extension TimesGroup: SuccLeftMul where Proof: SuccLeftMul { ... }  // group step (inserts extra tick)
```

### Commutativity: `a * b = b * a` (per fixed A)

Unlike addition commutativity (which transforms a single proof), multiplication commutativity must relate two structurally different proofs: `a * b` has b groups of a ticks, while `b * a` has a groups of b ticks. Swift's type system (lacking generic associated types) cannot express a universal transformation over both a and b simultaneously.

The solution decomposes commutativity into per-A protocols following the `_TimesNk` pattern. For each fixed A, the `_MulCommNk` protocol proves `A * b = b * A` for all b by paired induction:

```swift
// _MulCommN2: proves 2 * b = b * 2 for all b
// FwdProof constructs 2 * S(b) from 2 * b (2 ticks + group)
// RevProof constructs S(b) * 2 from b * 2 (SuccLeftMul.Distributed)
typealias MulComm2x3 = AddOne<AddOne<AddOne<_MulCommN2Seed>>>
assertEqual(MulComm2x3.FwdProof.Total.self, N6.self)  // 2 * 3 = 6
assertEqual(MulComm2x3.RevProof.Total.self, N6.self)  // 3 * 2 = 6
```

The reverse direction chains universally because `SuccLeftMul.Distributed` is itself required to conform to `SuccLeftMul` (a strengthened self-referential constraint). The forward direction hardcodes A ticks per group, hence the per-A protocol structure.

## Coinductive streams for irrational numbers

The convergent proofs above are bounded-depth: macros generate witness chains for specific values. Coinductive streams provide a complementary representation: the continued fraction coefficient sequence *itself* as a type.

A `CFStream` has a `Head` (the current coefficient) and a `Tail` (the rest of the stream). For periodic continued fractions, self-referential types create a productive fixed point -- Swift resolves these lazily, so chaining `.Tail.Tail...Head` always terminates:

```swift
// Golden ratio phi = [1; 1, 1, 1, ...]
struct PhiCF: CFStream {
    typealias Head = N1
    typealias Tail = PhiCF  // self-referential fixed point
}

// sqrt(2) = [1; 2, 2, 2, ...]
struct Sqrt2CF: CFStream {
    typealias Head = N1
    typealias Tail = Sqrt2Periodic  // enters the periodic part
}
```

Coefficient extraction works at any depth:

```swift
assertEqual(PhiCF.Head.self, N1.self)               // a_0 = 1
assertEqual(PhiCF.Tail.Tail.Tail.Head.self, N1.self) // a_3 = 1
assertStreamEqual(PhiCF.Tail.self, PhiCF.self)       // the fixed point
```

Universal unfold theorems prove that periodic streams unfold to themselves at *any* depth, not just specific ones. The proof uses the Seed-based induction pattern:

```swift
// PhiUnfold: for any n, the n-th Tail of PhiCF is PhiCF
assertStreamEqual(AddOne<AddOne<AddOne<PhiUnfoldSeed>>>.Unfolded.self, PhiCF.self)
```

**Limitation:** The streams encode the *identity* of an irrational number (its coefficient sequence), not the *computation* of convergents. The CF recurrence `h_{n+1} = a*h_n + h_{n-1}` requires adding two abstract naturals in one step, which Swift's conditional conformance cannot express. Convergent computation remains bounded-depth via macros.

## sqrt(2) CF and matrix construction

The sqrt(2) continued fraction [1; 2, 2, 2, ...] has convergents that can be computed either by the three-term recurrence (h_n = 2h_{n-1} + h_{n-2}) or by iterated left-multiplication by the matrix [[2,1],[1,0]]. The `@Sqrt2ConvergenceProof(depth:)` macro constructs both representations and proves they agree:

```swift
@Sqrt2ConvergenceProof(depth: 3)
enum Sqrt2Proof {}

assertEqual(Sqrt2Proof._MAT3.A.self, Sqrt2Proof._CF3.P.self)  // 17 = 17
assertEqual(Sqrt2Proof._MAT3.B.self, Sqrt2Proof._CF3.Q.self)  // 12 = 12
```
